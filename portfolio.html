<p style="color:rgb(48, 96, 240);"> My second paragraph in the lab. So a little about myself before we get into that. My name is Umar ...you'll have to look back up for the rest of my government name, ha ha I've got jokes.
<br> I added a break for no reason other than to see how it works that way when I use it in my future codes its tested, trusted and approved already. I hope you see it. Lastly I wanted to write a pragraph about myself by walking you through an original thought. I hope you enjoyed it. </p>
